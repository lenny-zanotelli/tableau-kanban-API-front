## General Information
  This is a training project where we were able to first learn how to create a complete CRUD API. 
  Then we created a minimalist visual. 
  Finally we combined the two projects to create a full-stack application.

- SortableJS - version 1.15

## Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
Create an `.env` file and change the data necessary for the connection.
You must create and import the database present in the 'data' folder. 

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed and Database configure, you can run  `npm run dev` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000

## Project Status

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Deploy the application
- Create a better front
